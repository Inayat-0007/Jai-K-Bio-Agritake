When handling navigation in the Jai K Bio Agritake website
- Always close mobile menu and dropdowns after navigation
- Hash navigation should wait for components to load before scrolling
- Corporate page sections must have proper IDs matching navigation links
- Navigation links should work from any page to any section
- Use smooth scrolling behavior for better user experience
- Increase timeout for hash navigation to ensure DOM is ready
- Dropdown parent items (like Corporate) must be clickable links, not just buttons
- Use anchor tags with onClick handlers for all navigation items
